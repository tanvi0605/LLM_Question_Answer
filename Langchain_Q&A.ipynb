            "Mobile phones have become an essential part of our lives. They are used for a variety of purposes, from staying connected with friends and family to conducting business. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of mobile phones, and I will argue that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the main benefits of mobile phones is that they provide a convenient way to stay connected with friends and family. You can use a mobile phone to call, text, or video chat with loved ones who live far away. This can be especially helpful for people who are frequently on the move or who have busy schedules. In addition, mobile phones allow you to share your thoughts and feelings with others instantly. You can send a text message to a friend to let them know you're thinking of them, or you can post a status update on social media to share your latest news with the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another benefit of mobile phones is that they can be used to conduct business. You can use a mobile phone to make calls, send emails, and access information on the internet. This can be helpful for people who work remotely or who need to stay connected with clients while they're on the go. In addition, mobile phones can be used to scan documents, take notes, and create presentations. This makes them a valuable tool for professionals who need to be able to work on their projects from anywhere.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, there are also some drawbacks to mobile phones. One drawback is that they can be addictive. People who use their mobile phones excessively may find it difficult to focus on other tasks, and they may experience anxiety or depression if they are unable to use their phones. In addition, mobile phones can be a distraction. People who use their phones while driving or walking are more likely to be involved in accidents. Mobile phones can also be used to access inappropriate content, which can be harmful to children and teens.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the benefits of mobile phones outweigh the drawbacks. Mobile phones provide a convenient way to stay connected with friends and family, conduct business, and access information. However, it is important to use mobile phones in moderation and to be aware of the potential risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some tips for using mobile phones safely and responsibly:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Set limits on your mobile phone use. Avoid using your phone while driving or walking.\n",
            "* Use parental controls to restrict your children's access to inappropriate content.\n",
            "* Be aware of the risks of cyberbullying and sexting.\n",
            "* Protect your privacy by using strong passwords and security settings.\n",
            "* If you are experiencing problems with mobile phone addiction, seek professional help.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these tips, you can use mobile phones to improve your life without experiencing the negative consequences.\n"

If you are talking about a pure visualization tool Tableau is slightly better. Data connectors, modeling and transformation features are available in both. However, factually speaking Power BI is cheaper and offers tighter integration with the Microsoft environment. Since most companies use excel & Microsoft tools they start with Power BI or move towards Power BI for seamless integration with other Microsoft tools (called as Power platform).

Here are some key distinctions:\\n\\n1. Focus: Business analysts focus on the business side of things, such as business processes, workflows, and strategies. They use data analysis to identify business problems, opportunities, and solutions. Data analysts, on the other hand, focus on the data itself. They collect, process, and analyze data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.\\n2. Skill set: Business analysts need to have strong communication, problem-solving, and strategic thinking skills, as they often work closely with stakeholders and decision-makers to identify business needs and develop solutions. They also need to have some knowledge of data analysis, such as data visualization and basic statistical analysis. Data analysts, on the other hand, need to have a strong foundation in data analysis and programming skills, such as SQL, Python, etc. They also need to have a good understanding of data visualization and statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.\\n3. Tools: Business analysts typically use tools like spreadsheets, business process modeling software, and business intelligence (BI) tools to analyze data and create reports. Data analysts use more advanced tools like statistical software, programming languages, and database management systems to collect, process, and analyze data.\\n4. Outputs: Business analysts typically produce reports, presentations, and recommendations based on their analysis of the data. Data analysts produce statistical models, visualizations, and reports to help stakeholders understand the data and make informed decisions.\\n\\nI recommend watching this video by Dhaval sir which explained more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFRpbPKTG4&t=1s'),\n",

But it has a limitation like King of the chess board - it can go only compare 1 year backward for a given day, month, week, or quarter. If you want to go backward or forward or if you need to go 3 or 6 months/years/days you need to use DATEADD().\\n\\nDATEADD() is more like the queen of the chessboard. It is very dynamic as it compares a day, month, quarter, year, etc. over any specified no. of time period.\\n\\nPARALLELPERIOD() works exactly like DATEADD() but there is a minor difference. Parallelperiod() does not work dynamically like DATEADD().\\n\\nFor example, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous month's value for dates between 1/5/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare these 12 days with the entire previous month of April 2023 (1/4/2023 - 30/4/2023) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same days (1/4/2023- 12/4/2023).\\n\\nLikewise, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous year's value for dates between 1/1/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare this time period with the entire previous year 2022 (1/1/2022 - 31/12/2022) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same period (1/1/2022- 12/5/2022).\\n\\nRefer this thread for more info: https://discord.com/channels/1090613684163850280/1106528524023648326\"),\n",

However, you may be involved in designing the structure and schema of a database, as well as configuring and populating it with data.\\n\\nCreating a database usually falls under the purview of a database administrator (DBA) or a data engineer. These roles are focused on the technical aspects of database design, implementation, and maintenance.\\n\\nAs a data analyst, your primary responsibilities would typically include querying and analyzing data within an existing database, creating reports and visualizations to communicate insights, and helping to inform business decisions based on data analysis.

The customer\\'s table has a primary key column called \"customer_id\", and the orders table has a foreign key column called \"customer_id\" that references the \"customer_id\" column in the customer\\'s table.\\n\\nBy establishing this relationship between the two tables, we can ensure that every order in the orders table is associated with a valid customer in the customer\\'s table.'),\n",
